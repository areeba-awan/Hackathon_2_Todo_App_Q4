## Prompt

Create the Phase I technical plan for the Todo in-memory Python console application.

The plan must be derived strictly from the Phase I specification and global constitution.

Include:
1. High-level application structure (single Python program)
2. In-memory data structures to store tasks
3. Task identification strategy (ID generation)
4. CLI control flow (menu loop, user input handling)
5. Separation of responsibilities (data handling vs CLI)
6. Error handling strategy for invalid input and missing tasks

Constraints:
- No databases
- No file storage
- No web frameworks
- No external services
- No future phase concepts

The plan must not introduce new features.
It must only describe HOW the approved Phase I requirements will be implemented.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive technical plan for Phase I todo console application including:
- Full project structure (src/models/, src/services/, src/cli/)
- Data model with Task dataclass and TaskList
- ID generation via sequential counter
- CLI layer with menu.py and handlers.py separation
- Error handling strategy table
- All constitution checks passed

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Technical plan for Phase I in-memory todo console app complete
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: plan.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/todo-service.yaml, contracts/cli-interface.yaml
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate testable tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Simple, focused implementation with clear separation of concerns

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
