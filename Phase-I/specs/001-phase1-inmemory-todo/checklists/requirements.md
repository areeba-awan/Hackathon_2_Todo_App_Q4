- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

- All 5 user stories defined with P1 priority (core CRUD operations)
- Each story includes 2-4 acceptance scenarios
- Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) are clear and testable
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006) are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Out of Scope section clearly defines Phase I boundaries
- Assumptions are documented
- Edge cases are identified and addressed
